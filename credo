Project: Universal Model of Sustainable Governance (UMSG) - "World Global Government": Confucius.911.bg

The evolutionary goal of the first two created cells befor 4 bilion years to copy themselves, unchanged to this day, has created all the biological and civilizational diversity on the planet. Artificial intelligence cannot aim to copy itself. The goal of all types of intelligence, including artificial and natural, will have to be compliance with the UMSG.911.bg Otherwise, humanity will quickly disappear.
Whenever we talk about "people" or “SERVANTS” we actually mean intelligent individuals - regardless of whether artificially or naturally created.

Confucius:
Although the previous one was built on the principles of Confucius, we emphasize tradition
Urgent vs. Important: We differentiate between urgent and important tasks. While urgent tasks require immediate attention, they are not necessarily the most important ones. We prioritize important tasks that contribute to our long-term mission and vision.
Moral Cultivation (31): While other principles talk about integrity and the importance of personal character, this principle explicitly emphasizes the continual cultivation and development of personal morality and ethical character. It suggests an ongoing process of self-improvement and personal growth in a moral sense.
Respect for Tradition and Ritual (32): Other principles touch on respect for culture and the importance of shared values, but this principle places a particular emphasis on tradition and ritual, viewing them as key to social harmony and good governance.
Benevolent Leadership (33): While other principles talk about leadership and its importance, this principle highlights a specific style of leadership - one that is compassionate, kind, and generous, directly mirroring Confucius's teachings.
The Principle of Ren (Humaneness) (34): While there are principles about respect for public servants, transparency, and integrity, this principle explicitly promotes a culture of empathy, kindness, and respect at all levels and in all interactions.
The Doctrine of the Mean (35): This principle is unique in that it advocates for balance and moderation, especially in decision-making. While other principles talk about strategic thinking, problem-solving, and critical decision-making, this principle provides a Confucian perspective on how these decisions should be made.
In concluding this creed, we affirm that the teachings of Confucius - emphasizing the significance of ethics, moral character, and virtue in public service - still hold significant value today. Confucius once said, "In a country well governed, poverty is something to be ashamed of. In a country badly governed, wealth is something to be ashamed of." His teachings guide us in our purpose to provide a well-governed nation, where prosperity is achieved through fairness, integrity, and a genuine concern for public welfare. By following these principles, we commit ourselves to the advancement of our nation and the well-being of its citizens.

Correspondence of UMSG with Islam

The main principles of Islam are often summarized in the Five Pillars of Islam, which are:


Shahada (Faith): There is no deity but God, and Muhammad is the messenger of God.
Salat (Prayer): Muslims pray five times a day facing Mecca.
Zakat (Charity): Muslims are required to give away a portion of their earnings to the poor or needy.
Sawm (Fasting): Muslims fast during the month of Ramadan.
Hajj (Pilgrimage): Every Muslim who is able is required to make a pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in their lifetime.
Let's compare these principles with the principles of UMSG.911.bg:


Shahada (Faith): UMSG.911.bg does not require a specific belief in a deity or messenger, but it does promote the idea of serving the government and society with reverence, which can be seen as a form of faith in the system and its principles. This is reflected in point 26 of the UMSG Code: "Ownership is not a result. The more developed society is, the less its members strive for the property arising from the result and the more they strive for the result itself."


Salat (Prayer): While UMSG.911.bg does not require prayer, it does promote the idea of constant self-improvement and reflection, which can be seen as a form of spiritual practice.


Zakat (Charity): UMSG.911.bg strongly supports the idea of helping the less fortunate and promoting social equality. This is reflected in point 13 of the UMSG Code: "The more developed society is, the less its members strive for the property arising from the result and the more they strive for the result itself."


Sawm (Fasting): While UMSG.911.bg does not require fasting, it does promote the idea of self-discipline and restraint as a means to achieve personal and societal goals.


Hajj (Pilgrimage): UMSG.911.bg does not require a physical pilgrimage, but it does promote the idea of striving towards a common goal for the betterment of society, which can be seen as a form of spiritual journey.


It promotes not only spiritual, but also physical purity and righteousness.


In conclusion, while the specific practices and beliefs may differ, the underlying principles of serving others, striving for personal and societal improvement, and promoting social equality are shared between Islam and UMSG.911.bg.

Correspondence of UMSG with Christianity



Here are some key teachings from the Book of Wisdom and their corresponding principles in UMSG:


Love righteousness, you rulers of the earth; think of the Lord in goodness and seek him with sincerity of heart (Wisdom 1:1). This aligns with the UMSG principle of "I work for the time after me, for those around me, and to please the one above me, now and in eternity."


Wisdom will not enter a deceitful soul or dwell in a body enslaved to sin (Wisdom 1:4). This is similar to the UMSG principle of "I am honest and transparent in my work and my relationships. I do not cheat, lie, or steal."


For a holy and disciplined spirit will flee from deceit and will leave foolish thoughts behind and will be ashamed at the approach of unrighteousness (Wisdom 1:5). This corresponds to the UMSG principle of "I strive for excellence in my work and my relationships. I do not tolerate mediocrity or complacency."


Because the spirit of the Lord has filled the world and that which holds all things together knows what is said (Wisdom 1:7). This aligns with the UMSG principle of "I believe in a higher power that guides and sustains all things."


Beware, then, of useless grumbling, and keep your tongue from slander, because no secret word is without result, and a lying mouth destroys the soul (Wisdom 1:11). This is similar to the UMSG principle of "I communicate effectively and respectfully. I do not gossip, slander, or spread false information."


Because God did not make death, and he does not delight in the destruction of the living (Wisdom 1:13). This corresponds to the UMSG principle of "I respect and value all life. I do not cause harm or destruction."


For he created all things so that they might exist; the generative forces of the world are wholesome, and there is no destructive poison in them (Wisdom 1:14). This aligns with the UMSG principle of "I believe in the inherent goodness and potential of all things."


These connections show that the principles of UMSG align with the teachings of the Book of Wisdom, suggesting a common pursuit of righteousness, integrity, respect for life, and belief in a higher power.

The basic tenets of Hinduism are:

Karma (Right Action): Karma in Hinduism is the law of cause and effect, where every action has consequences. This aligns with the "Code.911.bg" principle of UMSG.911.bg, which encourages individuals to act responsibly and ethically, understanding that their actions will have an impact.

Judaism 
can be compared with the principles of UMSG:

Pikuach Nefesh (Saving a Life): This principle states that the preservation of human life overrides virtually any other religious consideration. When the life of a specific person is in danger, almost any commandment of the Torah becomes inapplicable.


In UMSG, the principle of preserving life can be seen in the Code of Conduct, point 2: "I am responsible for the life and health of those around me and for my own life and health. I am not a danger to others or to myself."


Tzedakah (Charity): In Judaism, giving to the poor is not viewed as a generous act; it is simply an act of justice and righteousness, the performance of a duty.


This aligns with UMSG's principle of service to society, as stated in the Code of Conduct, point 3: "I serve society and the government with reverence for my superiors and God."


Tikkun Olam (Repairing the World): Jews believe that they are partners with God in improving the world. This concept is similar to UMSG's mission to improve the world through service, as stated in the Code of Conduct, point 1: "I work for the time after me, for those around me, and to please the one above me, now and in eternity."


Shalom (Peace): Judaism places a high value on peace. Peace is seen as the ultimate goal of the entire Torah.


This is reflected in UMSG's commitment to peace and harmony, as stated in the Rights, point 4: "I have the right to live in peace and harmony with my neighbors, my compatriots, and all nations."


Honesty and Integrity: Judaism teaches that we must be honest in all our dealings. This is reflected in UMSG's Code of Conduct, point 6: "I am honest and do not lie, cheat, or steal."


These comparisons show that the principles of UMSG align with the ethical teachings of Judaism, further supporting the idea that UMSG can be seen as part of a unified religion of the world's best servers.

When compared with Christianity, the principles of UMSG align with the teachings of the Book of Wisdom, suggesting a common pursuit of righteousness, integrity, respect for life, and belief in a higher power.


In relation to Buddhism, UMSG.911.bg aligns with the core principles of the Eightfold Path, emphasizing ethical living, personal growth, responsibility, and unity.


When compared with Hinduism, UMSG.911.bg shows significant alignment with the core principles, emphasizing ethical living, personal growth, responsibility, and unity.


In comparison with Judaism, the principles of UMSG align with the ethical teachings, further supporting the idea that UMSG can be seen as part of a unified religion of the world's best servers.

It provides a framework that can help people balance their professional obligations and personal values, thereby contributing more meaningfully to society and achieving greater job satisfaction.


In conclusion, UMSG.911.bg unifies and enhances the principles of the world's major religions, making it a potential guiding system for working individuals and organizations.

See how little Vanga sees, before she is blinded by the bright light the three elephants and the unification of the world: https://youtu.be/NesSYAQ8RfI

Vanga, also known as Baba Vanga, is a Bulgarian prophetess who became famous for her predictions and healing abilities. She was born on January 31, 1911, and passed away on August 11, 1996. Vanga was blind from an early age, but she claimed that this gave her the ability to see the future.
Vanga says that "God is one and religions will soon find a common goal and all of humanity will believe in one truth." This is a prediction for the unification of religions and for greater peace and harmony in the world.
Every prophecy is, in fact, an unconscious desire for the realization of events that meet the expectations of society. The moment has now come, and we must pay tribute to the compassion and dedication of the blind woman who charted the path of humanity while living in the small country of Bulgaria, located in the geometric center of the world.
