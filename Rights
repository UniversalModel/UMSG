FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF THE CIVIL SERVANT

Project: Universal Model of Sustainable Governance (UMSG) - "World Global Government": Confucius.911.bg

The evolutionary goal of the first two created cells befor 4 bilion years to copy themselves, unchanged to this day, has created all the biological and civilizational diversity on the planet. Artificial intelligence cannot aim to copy itself. The goal of all types of intelligence, including artificial and natural, will have to be compliance with the UMSG.911.bg Otherwise, humanity will quickly disappear.
Whenever we talk about "people" or “SERVANTS” we actually mean intelligent individuals - regardless of whether artificially or naturally created.

World Government Servant Rights

When desires become rights, then freedom becomes a "feeling of freedom." These are not all desires, but the most essential and useful for society and organizations desires of citizens in organizations.
They are borrowed from one of the largest Gallup Research 'In search of the spirit of organizations', conducted among the employees of the 400 largest and most successful, so-called 'eternal' - at the top, no matter who runs them, global companies (Johnson and Johnson, General Electric, etc.), which asked more than 80 million questions to 800,000 employees. The idea was to find the most significant expectations of employees, but only those that are related (correlated) with maximizing productivity, efficiency, profit, and quality of customer service of their companies. It is natural and most meaningful for these expectations to be declared as rights.

Although the previous one was built on the principles of Confucius, we emphasize tradition. Drawing from Confucianism, we can add the following additional rights of civil servants that reflect Confucian ideals:
"Right to moral conduct: Civil servants should be guaranteed an environment that upholds, respects, and encourages ethical and moral conduct, in line with the teachings of Confucius."
"Right to familial consideration: Reflecting the Confucian principle of filial piety, civil servants should have their familial responsibilities and obligations considered in their work scheduling and requirements."
"Right to harmony: Civil servants should have the right to work in an environment that fosters harmony and mutual respect, reflecting the Confucian ideal of a harmonious society."
"Right to benevolence: Civil servants should be treated with benevolence (ren), reflecting the importance of compassion and empathy in Confucian philosophy."
"Right to respect for seniority: Reflecting the Confucian emphasis on respect for elders and superiors, civil servants should have the right to an environment that respects seniority and hierarchical relationships, while still fostering a spirit of equality and fairness."
"Right to social responsibility: Civil servants should be supported in their commitment to serve the community and the state, reflecting the Confucian ideal of social responsibility and commitment to public service."
Epilogue:
The teachings of Confucius have shaped many societies over the centuries, instilling values of morality, social responsibility, respect, and wisdom. These principles find resonance in the rights and responsibilities of civil servants. Confucius himself held a position akin to that of a civil servant when he administered the province of Lu, and his teachings provide profound insights into how public servants can strive for excellence, integrity, and public welfare.
Confucian ideals like "ren" (benevolence), "li" (proper behavior), and "xiao" (filial piety) can enrich the cultural fabric of public service, promoting an environment of trust, respect, and ethical conduct. In line with Confucian philosophy, the civil servant's role extends beyond mere duty—it encompasses a deeper commitment to the betterment of society and the state, anchored in moral principles and ethical conduct.
Through this lens, the rights of civil servants are not merely legal or occupational provisions but moral imperatives that uphold the dignity, worth, and potential of each individual. The teachings of Confucius guide us in envisioning a public service culture that fosters harmony, respects human dignity, and inspires dedicated service for the common good. As we affirm these rights, we commit to nurturing a culture of public service that Confucius himself would have admired—one that embodies integrity, benevolence, respect, and wisdom.

Correspondence of UMSG with Islam

The main principles of Islam are often summarized in the Five Pillars of Islam, which are:


Shahada (Faith): There is no deity but God, and Muhammad is the messenger of God.
Salat (Prayer): Muslims pray five times a day facing Mecca.
Zakat (Charity): Muslims are required to give away a portion of their earnings to the poor or needy.
Sawm (Fasting): Muslims fast during the month of Ramadan.
Hajj (Pilgrimage): Every Muslim who is able is required to make a pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in their lifetime.
Let's compare these principles with the principles of UMSG.911.bg:


Shahada (Faith): UMSG.911.bg does not require a specific belief in a deity or messenger, but it does promote the idea of serving the government and society with reverence, which can be seen as a form of faith in the system and its principles. This is reflected in point 26 of the UMSG Code: "Ownership is not a result. The more developed society is, the less its members strive for the property arising from the result and the more they strive for the result itself."


Salat (Prayer): While UMSG.911.bg does not require prayer, it does promote the idea of constant self-improvement and reflection, which can be seen as a form of spiritual practice.


Zakat (Charity): UMSG.911.bg strongly supports the idea of helping the less fortunate and promoting social equality. This is reflected in point 13 of the UMSG Code: "The more developed society is, the less its members strive for the property arising from the result and the more they strive for the result itself."


Sawm (Fasting): While UMSG.911.bg does not require fasting, it does promote the idea of self-discipline and restraint as a means to achieve personal and societal goals.


Hajj (Pilgrimage): UMSG.911.bg does not require a physical pilgrimage, but it does promote the idea of striving towards a common goal for the betterment of society, which can be seen as a form of spiritual journey.


It promotes not only spiritual, but also physical purity and righteousness.


In conclusion, while the specific practices and beliefs may differ, the underlying principles of serving others, striving for personal and societal improvement, and promoting social equality are shared between Islam and UMSG.911.bg.

Correspondence of UMSG with Christianity



Here are some key teachings from the Book of Wisdom and their corresponding principles in UMSG:


Love righteousness, you rulers of the earth; think of the Lord in goodness and seek him with sincerity of heart (Wisdom 1:1). This aligns with the UMSG principle of "I work for the time after me, for those around me, and to please the one above me, now and in eternity."


Wisdom will not enter a deceitful soul or dwell in a body enslaved to sin (Wisdom 1:4). This is similar to the UMSG principle of "I am honest and transparent in my work and my relationships. I do not cheat, lie, or steal."


For a holy and disciplined spirit will flee from deceit and will leave foolish thoughts behind and will be ashamed at the approach of unrighteousness (Wisdom 1:5). This corresponds to the UMSG principle of "I strive for excellence in my work and my relationships. I do not tolerate mediocrity or complacency."


Because the spirit of the Lord has filled the world and that which holds all things together knows what is said (Wisdom 1:7). This aligns with the UMSG principle of "I believe in a higher power that guides and sustains all things."


Beware, then, of useless grumbling, and keep your tongue from slander, because no secret word is without result, and a lying mouth destroys the soul (Wisdom 1:11). This is similar to the UMSG principle of "I communicate effectively and respectfully. I do not gossip, slander, or spread false information."


Because God did not make death, and he does not delight in the destruction of the living (Wisdom 1:13). This corresponds to the UMSG principle of "I respect and value all life. I do not cause harm or destruction."


For he created all things so that they might exist; the generative forces of the world are wholesome, and there is no destructive poison in them (Wisdom 1:14). This aligns with the UMSG principle of "I believe in the inherent goodness and potential of all things."


These connections show that the principles of UMSG align with the teachings of the Book of Wisdom, suggesting a common pursuit of righteousness, integrity, respect for life, and belief in a higher power.

Judaism 
can be compared with the principles of UMSG:

Pikuach Nefesh (Saving a Life): This principle states that the preservation of human life overrides virtually any other religious consideration. When the life of a specific person is in danger, almost any commandment of the Torah becomes inapplicable.


In UMSG, the principle of preserving life can be seen in the Code of Conduct, point 2: "I am responsible for the life and health of those around me and for my own life and health. I am not a danger to others or to myself."


Tzedakah (Charity): In Judaism, giving to the poor is not viewed as a generous act; it is simply an act of justice and righteousness, the performance of a duty.


This aligns with UMSG's principle of service to society, as stated in the Code of Conduct, point 3: "I serve society and the government with reverence for my superiors and God."


Tikkun Olam (Repairing the World): Jews believe that they are partners with God in improving the world. This concept is similar to UMSG's mission to improve the world through service, as stated in the Code of Conduct, point 1: "I work for the time after me, for those around me, and to please the one above me, now and in eternity."


Shalom (Peace): Judaism places a high value on peace. Peace is seen as the ultimate goal of the entire Torah.


This is reflected in UMSG's commitment to peace and harmony, as stated in the Rights, point 4: "I have the right to live in peace and harmony with my neighbors, my compatriots, and all nations."


Honesty and Integrity: Judaism teaches that we must be honest in all our dealings. This is reflected in UMSG's Code of Conduct, point 6: "I am honest and do not lie, cheat, or steal."


These comparisons show that the principles of UMSG align with the ethical teachings of Judaism, further supporting the idea that UMSG can be seen as part of a unified religion of the world's best servers.

See how little Vanga sees, before she is blinded by the bright light the three elephants and the unification of the world: https://youtu.be/NesSYAQ8RfI

Vanga, also known as Baba Vanga, is a Bulgarian prophetess who became famous for her predictions and healing abilities. She was born on January 31, 1911, and passed away on August 11, 1996. Vanga was blind from an early age, but she claimed that this gave her the ability to see the future.
Vanga says that "God is one and religions will soon find a common goal and all of humanity will believe in one truth." This is a prediction for the unification of religions and for greater peace and harmony in the world.
Every prophecy is, in fact, an unconscious desire for the realization of events that meet the expectations of society. The moment has now come, and we must pay tribute to the compassion and dedication of the blind woman who charted the path of humanity while living in the small country of Bulgaria, located in the geometric center of the world.
