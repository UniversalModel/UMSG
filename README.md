Universal Model of Sustainable Governance
          Project: Universal Model of Sustainable Governance (UMSG.911.bg)
"World Global Government"

1. People should not harm themselves - CODE.911.bg

2. Organizations must be effective in serving people - CREDO.911.bg

3. People should have correct and realistic expectations - RIGHTS.911.bg


The evolutionary goal of the first two created cells befor 4 bilion years to copy themselves, unchanged to this day, has created all the biological and civilizational diversity on the planet. Artificial intelligence cannot aim to copy itself. The goal of all types of intelligence, including artificial and natural, will have to be compliance with the UMSG.911.bg Otherwise, humanity will disappear.
Whenever we talk about "people" we actually mean intelligent individuals - regardless of whether artificially or naturally created.

Your Excellency, President Xi Jinping and President Trump, Esteemed Leaders of BRICS, 
Dear, Followers of Confucius and Emperor Constantine,
Dear, Followers of Great Presidents and Leaders of the World like Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, Mr. Ronald Reagan, Mrs. Margaret Thatcher, Mr. Albert Einstein, Mr. Charlie Chaplin and… Mr. Bill Gates and Mrs. Melinda Gates, Mr. George Soros, Mr Musk, Mr. Jeff Bezos, Mr. Ford, Mr. Walton, Mr. Bloomberg, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Warren Buffet, Mr. Mark Zuckerberg and Mrs. Priscilla Chan
Proposal for joint work, on three documents Code, Credo and Rights of Civil servants. In each of which you will find a red link: to comment... which leads to drafts of a joint document with public access for commenting.

I am inspired by Confucius's teachings that reflect on governance, "In a well-governed country, poverty is something to be ashamed of. In a country badly governed, wealth is something to be ashamed of." This profound wisdom is indicative of the current state of affairs in Bulgaria and calls for an urgent need for change.
I offer a solution to the biggest problems in society, namely: 1. People harming each other - the elephant on the left. 3. Organizations are inefficient and compete unfairly - the solution is elephants in the middle. 2. People have incorrect expectations - the solution is the elephant on the right.
Then:
1. People should not harm each other - CODE
2. Organizations must be effective in serving people - CREDO
3. People should have proper and realistic expectations - RIGHTS

With this in mind, I propose a significant reform that involves the adoption of three key documents for all state and municipal organizations: a Code of Conduct, a Credo, and a Rights document. These three pillars are inspired by the universal principles inherent in the world's religions, the Codex of Emperor Constantine, the Creed of Toyota, a corporation known for its strategic vision, often associated with Confucian teachings and one of the biggest sociological studies in the world about the spirit of the greatest for all times organizations: "Created Eternal". You can find these documents at credo.911.bg, code.911.bg, and rights.911.bg.

Implementing these guiding documents intends to establish an ethical and productive governance framework. This balanced system respects the personal interests of the civil servants while aligning with the broader interests of the organization and society. The goal is a shift from the current governance, often in the hands of individuals lacking competence, towards a structure managed by capable and intelligent leaders.

Considering the goals of the "One Belt, One Road" - initiative, aiming to strengthen economic and cultural ties among nations, I believe the implementation of these practices can contribute to the development of fair and efficient governance. (item 1 of the Code listen to a tale by Confucius - https://youtu.be/wacgP2tan7w, chorus - https://on.soundcloud.com/SczV3)

Firstly, each organization should adopt a daily cycle of review, resembling the ISO 9000 quality standard. This cycle would involve daily examination of an item from the Code of Conduct, Basic Rights, and Creed. This constant reassessment, along with appropriate incentives and sanctions, ensures the principles are firmly upheld.

Through successful implementation, we anticipate increased productivity, efficiency, profit, and citizen satisfaction. As a result, we foresee a reduction in mortality and a fostering of entrepreneurial freedom.

Secondly, there is an urgent need to advocate for legislation that endorses ethical conduct, principles, and high-quality governance in Bulgarian organizations. This law would guarantee compliance with the system and facilitate our transition towards superior and equitable governance.

Inspired by Confucius and Lao Tzu's teachings, the implementation of these measures could bring significant improvements in our governance, marking a pivotal step towards fairness and efficiency.

The Silk Road, a metaphorical bridge connecting Emperor Constantine and Confucius, serves to unite their teachings to improve society. It represents a journey into the depth of our shared human experience, where we learn from each other's wisdom and work collaboratively for a better world.

Thinking about my country Bulgaria (the most dying people in the world in the fire of an administrative hell), I came to the conclusion that, although to a lesser extent, these principles of governance would benefit all peoples of the world.

Let us walk this path together, blending the wisdom of the past with the aspirations of the future, creating a better world for all.

Your Excellency, …….. ,

I hope this message finds you well.
My name is …………………  and I am writing to you on behalf of the team developing the Universal Model of Sustainable Governance (UMSG.911.bg).
The UMSG is a novel model designed to address complex societal problems through three core principles, inspired by the concept of the 'three elephants':

1. People should not harm 
     each other - CODE.911.bg
2. Organizations must be effective 
     in serving people - CREDO.911.bg
3. People should have proper and realistic 
     expectations - RIGHTS.911.bg

This system, which is offered through http://Letter.911.bg, has been carefully created and is incredibly well thought-out.
It includes three key documents: http://Code.911.bg, http://Credo.911.bg, and http://Rights.911.bg.
We believe that the UMSG has the potential to create a more stable and predictable international system by standardizing governance.
It promotes sustainable development, protects human rights, and encourages environmentally conscious policies.

Additionally, the UMSG may reduce the risk of conflict and promote cooperation among nations. By implementing the UMSG, we aim to create a more just and sustainable world for future generations.
We are reaching out to you because of your expertise in government. We would greatly appreciate your insights and feedback on the UMSG.
Your engagement will help this model evolve and adapt to better serve our society.

Please let us know if you would be interested in reviewing the UMSG and providing your valuable feedback.
We believe that your expertise would greatly contribute to the development and refinement of this model.
Thank you for considering our request. We look forward to the possibility of your involvement.

Correspondence of UMSG with Islam

https://youtu.be/-OtcKDonppE
The main principles of Islam are often summarized in the Five Pillars of Islam, which are:


Shahada (Faith): There is no deity but God, and Muhammad is the messenger of God.
Salat (Prayer): Muslims pray five times a day facing Mecca.
Zakat (Charity): Muslims are required to give away a portion of their earnings to the poor or needy.
Sawm (Fasting): Muslims fast during the month of Ramadan.
Hajj (Pilgrimage): Every Muslim who is able is required to make a pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in their lifetime.
Let's compare these principles with the principles of UMSG.911.bg:


Shahada (Faith): UMSG.911.bg does not require a specific belief in a deity or messenger, but it does promote the idea of serving the government and society with reverence, which can be seen as a form of faith in the system and its principles. This is reflected in point 26 of the UMSG Code: "Ownership is not a result. The more developed society is, the less its members strive for the property arising from the result and the more they strive for the result itself."


Salat (Prayer): While UMSG.911.bg does not require prayer, it does promote the idea of constant self-improvement and reflection, which can be seen as a form of spiritual practice.


Zakat (Charity): UMSG.911.bg strongly supports the idea of helping the less fortunate and promoting social equality. This is reflected in point 13 of the UMSG Code: "The more developed society is, the less its members strive for the property arising from the result and the more they strive for the result itself."


Sawm (Fasting): While UMSG.911.bg does not require fasting, it does promote the idea of self-discipline and restraint as a means to achieve personal and societal goals.


Hajj (Pilgrimage): UMSG.911.bg does not require a physical pilgrimage, but it does promote the idea of striving towards a common goal for the betterment of society, which can be seen as a form of spiritual journey.


It promotes not only spiritual, but also physical purity and righteousness.


In conclusion, while the specific practices and beliefs may differ, the underlying principles of serving others, striving for personal and societal improvement, and promoting social equality are shared between Islam and UMSG.911.bg.

Correspondence of UMSG with Christianity

https://youtu.be/-OtcKDonppE


Here are some key teachings from the Book of Wisdom and their corresponding principles in UMSG:


Love righteousness, you rulers of the earth; think of the Lord in goodness and seek him with sincerity of heart (Wisdom 1:1). This aligns with the UMSG principle of "I work for the time after me, for those around me, and to please the one above me, now and in eternity."


Wisdom will not enter a deceitful soul or dwell in a body enslaved to sin (Wisdom 1:4). This is similar to the UMSG principle of "I am honest and transparent in my work and my relationships. I do not cheat, lie, or steal."


For a holy and disciplined spirit will flee from deceit and will leave foolish thoughts behind and will be ashamed at the approach of unrighteousness (Wisdom 1:5). This corresponds to the UMSG principle of "I strive for excellence in my work and my relationships. I do not tolerate mediocrity or complacency."


Because the spirit of the Lord has filled the world and that which holds all things together knows what is said (Wisdom 1:7). This aligns with the UMSG principle of "I believe in a higher power that guides and sustains all things."


Beware, then, of useless grumbling, and keep your tongue from slander, because no secret word is without result, and a lying mouth destroys the soul (Wisdom 1:11). This is similar to the UMSG principle of "I communicate effectively and respectfully. I do not gossip, slander, or spread false information."


Because God did not make death, and he does not delight in the destruction of the living (Wisdom 1:13). This corresponds to the UMSG principle of "I respect and value all life. I do not cause harm or destruction."


For he created all things so that they might exist; the generative forces of the world are wholesome, and there is no destructive poison in them (Wisdom 1:14). This aligns with the UMSG principle of "I believe in the inherent goodness and potential of all things."


These connections show that the principles of UMSG align with the teachings of the Book of Wisdom, suggesting a common pursuit of righteousness, integrity, respect for life, and belief in a higher power.

Right Speech: UMSG.911.bg promotes honest and non-hurtful communication, as seen in the principle "I do not lie, I do not mislead, I do not manipulate, I do not speculate" (Credo.911.bg, point 9).

The basic tenets of Hinduism are:


Dharma (Ethics and Duties): This principle emphasizes living according to moral and ethical duties. It aligns with the "Credo.911.bg" principle of UMSG.911.bg, which states that every person should be responsible for their actions and strive for personal and professional growth.


Samsara (Rebirth): This principle of Hinduism believes in the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. UMSG.911.bg does emphasize the importance of continuous learning and growth, which can be seen as a form of intellectual rebirth.


Karma (Right Action): Karma in Hinduism is the law of cause and effect, where every action has consequences. This aligns with the "Code.911.bg" principle of UMSG.911.bg, which encourages individuals to act responsibly and ethically, understanding that their actions will have an impact.


Moksha (Liberation from the cycle of Samsara): Moksha is the ultimate goal in Hinduism, representing liberation from the cycle of rebirth. This can be compared to the ultimate goal of UMSG.911.bg, which is to create a harmonious and united world.


Atman (Soul): Atman in Hinduism refers to the individual soul or self, which is eternal and divine. This aligns with the "Rights.911.bg" principle of UMSG.911.bg, which acknowledges the inherent dignity and worth of every individual.


Brahman (The Ultimate Reality): In Hinduism, Brahman is the ultimate reality or supreme cosmic power. This aligns with the UMSG.911.bg's belief in a united and harmonious world, which can be seen as an ultimate goal or reality.


Тhe principles of UMSG.911.bg show significant alignment with the core principles of Hinduism, emphasizing ethical living, personal growth, responsibility, and unity.

Judaism 
can be compared with the principles of UMSG:

https://youtu.be/-OtcKDonppE
Pikuach Nefesh (Saving a Life): This principle states that the preservation of human life overrides virtually any other religious consideration. When the life of a specific person is in danger, almost any commandment of the Torah becomes inapplicable.


In UMSG, the principle of preserving life can be seen in the Code of Conduct, point 2: "I am responsible for the life and health of those around me and for my own life and health. I am not a danger to others or to myself."


Tzedakah (Charity): In Judaism, giving to the poor is not viewed as a generous act; it is simply an act of justice and righteousness, the performance of a duty.


This aligns with UMSG's principle of service to society, as stated in the Code of Conduct, point 3: "I serve society and the government with reverence for my superiors and God."


Tikkun Olam (Repairing the World): Jews believe that they are partners with God in improving the world. This concept is similar to UMSG's mission to improve the world through service, as stated in the Code of Conduct, point 1: "I work for the time after me, for those around me, and to please the one above me, now and in eternity."


Shalom (Peace): Judaism places a high value on peace. Peace is seen as the ultimate goal of the entire Torah.


This is reflected in UMSG's commitment to peace and harmony, as stated in the Rights, point 4: "I have the right to live in peace and harmony with my neighbors, my compatriots, and all nations."


Honesty and Integrity: Judaism teaches that we must be honest in all our dealings. This is reflected in UMSG's Code of Conduct, point 6: "I am honest and do not lie, cheat, or steal."


These comparisons show that the principles of UMSG align with the ethical teachings of Judaism, further supporting the idea that UMSG can be seen as part of a unified religion of the world's best servers.

UMSG.911.bg is a unique system that unifies the principles of the world's major religions and enhances them by not only regulating individuals but also granting them rights to express their most essential socially beneficial desires that lead to productivity, efficiency, and mutual service. It also guides organizations towards effective management.


In comparison with Islam, UMSG.911.bg shares the underlying principles of serving others, striving for personal and societal improvement, and promoting social equality.


When compared with Christianity, the principles of UMSG align with the teachings of the Book of Wisdom, suggesting a common pursuit of righteousness, integrity, respect for life, and belief in a higher power.


In relation to Buddhism, UMSG.911.bg aligns with the core principles of the Eightfold Path, emphasizing ethical living, personal growth, responsibility, and unity.

See how little Vanga sees, before she is blinded by the bright light the three elephants and the unification of the world: https://youtu.be/NesSYAQ8RfI

https://youtu.be/NesSYAQ8RfI

Vanga, also known as Baba Vanga, is a Bulgarian prophetess who became famous for her predictions and healing abilities. She was born on January 31, 1911 (911.bg) , and passed away on August 11, 1996. Vanga was blind from an early age, but she claimed that this gave her the ability to see the future.
Vanga says that "God is one and religions will soon find a common goal and all of humanity will believe in one truth." This is a prediction for the unification of religions and for greater peace and harmony in the world.
Every prophecy is, in fact, an unconscious desire for the realization of events that meet the expectations of society. The moment has now come, and we must pay tribute to the compassion and dedication of the blind woman who charted the path of humanity while living in the small country of Bulgaria, located in the geometric center of the world.

Epilogue:
Ask yourself a question: Why in Ukraine, where there is a full-scale war, the death rate is 19/1000, and in Bulgaria it is 22/1000 ???
Is Hell on Earth here!? -https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.CDRT.IN?locations=BG 
Why is the death rate so high and the birth rate so low and the emigration enormous?. Isn't the state and municipal apparatus and the misanthropic and unjust principles of government responsible? Shouldn't they change?
When the concepts of GOOD and EVIL are not specified, HELL comes, HEAVEN does not come according to the most universal law of thermodynamics (LAW OF ENTROPY), that the natural state of any system without supplying energy from outside is the GROWTH OF CHAOS.

CONSENSUS IS NEEDED FOR GOOD AND EVIL IN SOCIETY MANAGEMENT!
THIS IS WHAT I OFFER!

When we change the climate, other flowers will bloom, not weeds and swamp mosses. Officials will comply, even if unconsciously, with the new ethical rules if they become the norm and law.
All depends on you!
Many of my friends and relatives died, I am miraculously alive, after numerous attempts of all kinds (like every enterprising Bulgarian, I am not unique)!

That's why I created UMSG.911.bg, to combat this!
